As a Ruby Developer I use Windows only if I want to play some games, because it is pretty hard to work with it. 
However WSL 2 is big step toward and I decided to try it. 
Previously I tried WSL 1 and it was painful to setup project, a lot of bugs and segfaults. 
With WSL 2 things are getting much better. 
In this post I'm not going to describe how to install it, it is pretty straightforward now, but more about useful stuff.

#### Install [Windows Terminal][win-term]
It is much better than default terminal, you can even use ctrl+c and ctrl+v ðŸ˜†

#### Setup your user 
By default you will be logged in as `root` user, it is not very good to have access to everything by default. I suggest creating separate sudo user 

```shell
sudo adduser simpl1g
```

You will be asked some questions along with password and at the end, youâ€™ll be prompted to confirm that the information you entered is correct.
Also add user to sudoers so that you can run commands as administrator
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo simpl1g
```

#### Set newly created user as default for WSL
Open default command prompt or PowerShell and run
```bash
ubuntu config --default-user simpl1g
```

#### Set default profile and folder for Windows Terminal

I found [this answer][so-answer] very usefull. So in the end I have in `settings.json`
```ruby
{ 
  "defaultProfile": "{2c4de342-38b7-51cf-b940-2309a097f518}" # Automatically open Terminal with Ubuntu
  ...
  {
    "colorScheme": "Solarized Dark",                         # Use Solarized color scheme of terminal
    "guid": "{2c4de342-38b7-51cf-b940-2309a097f518}",
    "hidden": false,
    "name": "Ubuntu",
    "source": "Windows.Terminal.Wsl",
    "startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\simpl1g"   # Default folder for your new user 
  }
}
```

Now you can start development like in normal Ubuntu, I was able to install and launch everything that was required for my daily work project. Happy coding)
